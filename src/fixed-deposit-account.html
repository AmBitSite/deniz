                <p class="about-us__text">
                    Fixed Deposit Account is an effective financial option, since it enables the customer to get a fixed
                    interest rate at the end of the investment period. Such type of the account has higher interest rate
                    compared to usual savings account. In return to the proposed privileges customer is obliged not to
                    withdraw the money till the end of the investment period.
                </p>
                <p class="about-us__text">
                    A Fixed Deposit implies guaranteed returns. Unlike commercial investments where returns vacillate
                    over the time, the returns on a Fixed Deposit are settled when you open the account. Even if
                    interest rates fall after you open a Fixed Deposit, you will continue to receive the interest
                    determined at the start. Fixed Deposits are considered much safer than investments in other assets
                    like equity.
                </p>
                <p class="about-us__text">
                    You can open a Fixed Deposit Account with our bank even in case you do not have a savings account.
                    However, you will need to complete know-your-customer (KYC) set of documents as it is a usual
                    procedure within the framework of Euro Deniz IBU Security Policies.
                </p>
                <p class="about-us__text">
                    The minimum amount needed to open a fixed deposit account is negotiable. However, there is no limit
                    on the maximum amount which a customer invests. In order to define the limits, please revert to your
                    personal manager.
                </p>
                <p class="about-us__text">
                    The customer is able to negotiate the Fixed Deposit terms with the personal manager. Usually a
                    customer invests in Fixed Deposit for the period from 3 to 10 years. The deposit tenure can
                    be chosen at your preference. Please consult your personal manager.
                </p>
                <p class="about-us__text">
                    Fixed Deposit maturity date could be broken in case of urgent conditions. A penalty may be levied by
                    the bank on premature withdrawals. The penalty amount is variable.
                </p>
