                    FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) and OECD are known to be applicable to US and EU
                    citizens respectively, created for financial information exchange for tax purposes. In 2014
                    CRS (Common Reporting Standard) was developed in response to G20 request and approved by the
                    OECD Council to attain information from their financial institutions and automatically
                    exchange that information with other jurisdictions on an annual basis.

                    The information required to be collected and reported to their tax authority is
                    automatically transferred between the domicile jurisdiction and those other countries
                    engaged into commitment. Designed to increase tax revenue, these rules are not applicable to
                    foreign financial institutions (FFI), such as banks and funds. Euro Deniz IBU can become the
                    good choice for the said purpose. Licensed with non-FATCA/CRS jurisdiction the exchange
