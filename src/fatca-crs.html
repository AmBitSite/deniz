                            FATCA (Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act) and OECD are known to be applicable to US and EU
                            citizens respectively, created for financial information exchange for tax purposes. In 2014
                            CRS (Common Reporting Standard) was developed in response to G20 request and approved by the
                            OECD Council to attain information from their financial institutions and automatically
                            exchange that information with other jurisdictions on an annual basis.

                            The information required to be collected and reported to their tax authority is
                            automatically transferred between the domicile jurisdiction and those other countries
                            engaged into commitment. Designed to increase tax revenue, these rules are not applicable to
                            foreign financial institutions (FFI), such as banks and funds. Euro Deniz IBU can become the
